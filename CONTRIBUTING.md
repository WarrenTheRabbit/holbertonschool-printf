### Commit examples

```
test: return NULL when malloc fails

This is a test for requirement #002: it checks whether
`_strdup` returns NULL when memory allocation fails.

To run the test:
       make test_that_null_is_returned_when_malloc_fails

The test uses 'malloc_fail_driver' as a prerequisite. It ensures
failure by overriding the call to malloc with a stub that always
returns NULL.
```

```
feat: pass return NULL when malloc fails

Adds a guard that checks whether malloc has returned NULL.
If NULL is returned, stops processing and returns NULL to the
caller.

Fulfils requirement #002.
```
